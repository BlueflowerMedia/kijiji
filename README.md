# Kijiji Scheduled Reposter

#### Kijiji Scheduled Reposter

## Setup

The project requires python3 with: python-requests, bs4, pyyaml, schedule
To install all dependencies, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

### Using the script

- Create a folder **ad#** i.e. ad1, ad2
- Place all the photos in the folder
- Create a yml file for the ad in the same name as the folder (either using the CLI the instruction in next section or editing exiting yml file)
- Create a schedule python file. Look at schedule1.py
- Start the file with import statement `from adScheduler import *`
- create a adSchedule class under any variable name with the following parameters
  - ad_id: this must match folder name of the ad yml file and ad yml filename
  - repeat: interval in minutes at which the ad is reposted
  - delay: number of minutes delayed before the ad is started
- i.e. for ad66 repeated every 30 minutes that will start after 30 minutes:
`ad1 = adSchedule(ad_id=66, repeat=30, delay=30)`
- to initiate a schedule, run the start function for each ad. i.e. `ad1.start()`
- end the file with
`while True:
    schedule.run_pending()`
- to run the script, simply run `python **nameOfTheFile**`


### Creating, Posting and Reposting an ad using the CLI

Create an yml file for an ad using kijiji_repost_headless :

`python kijiji_repost_headless build_ad`

Post one ad (item.yml):

`python kijiji_repost_headless [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] post myproduct/item.yml`

Repost one ad (item.yml); will delete the ad prior to posting if it already exists:

`python kijiji_repost_headless [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] repost myproduct/item.yml`

Show all active ads:

`python kijiji_repost_headless [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] show`

Delete all ads:

`python kijiji_repost_headless [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] nuke`

Delete one ad (using ad id):

`python kijiji_repost_headless [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] delete myAdId`
